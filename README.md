# How does it work
It is a hotkey to show/hide Alacritty.
While this software is running, Alacritty is activated by pressing the control key twice quickly.
Only works on Ubuntu, tested on 22.04.
Alacritty location and name: "/usr/local/bin/alacritty"
Alacritty title on window setting: "Alacritty"

## Suggested future improvements
- Stabilize operation
- Support for other than control key
- Support combination hotkeys instead of double press
- Support for Mac
